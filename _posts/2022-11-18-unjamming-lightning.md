For the past few months, I've been working with [Clara Shikhelman](https://clarashk.github.io/) at [Chaincode Labs](https://chaincode.com/) on the issue of [jamming attacks](https://bitcoinproblems.org/problems/channel-jamming.html) in the Lightning Network.

Our efforts have resulted in a [paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1454) where we propose a solution that combines small unconditional fees and local reputation.

I've written a post summarizing our findings for the Chaincode Research blog:
